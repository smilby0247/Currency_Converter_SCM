POA:

The goal of this program is to create a functional Currency Conversion application that takes a specified
amount of currency, and converts to another specified amount of currency using spinner menu items and text
boxes. The program will also have a language changer based on region from ENGLISH to the specified language
depending upon the geological positioning of the device (I.E., the device switch will change to ENG/FRA if
you are in France, so on.) The device will need to be very adaptable to mobile phones and tablets, and also
requires portrait and landscape compatibility.
